## [2026-05-26 00:00 UTC] — Agent: Replit Agent (Initial Setup)

### Task
Full project cleanup, rebrand from JazzMAX → RaddFlix, and agent coordination system setup.

### Done
- Deleted junk files from Oracle server and GitHub; repo reduced from ~200MB to 9MB
- Comprehensive `.gitignore` added
- Fixed 3 server errors: Node.js 18→20 upgrade, `/health` route + 405 handler in `app.py`, restored `hub/_legacy/` folder
- Full rebrand JazzMAX → RaddFlix: 80 replacements across 39 files (app name, package ID `com.jazzmax.app` → `com.raddflix.app`, Kotlin folder renamed, FCM channels, keystore, etc.)
- GitHub repo renamed `raddclub/jazzmax-app` → `raddclub/raddflix-app`; server git remote updated
- Remaining flutter cleanup: `build.gradle` fallback keystore/alias, `network_security_config.xml` comment, `jazz_colors.dart` → `radd_colors.dart` (extension + 8 properties renamed), `jazz_text_field.dart` → `radd_text_field.dart` (class renamed), all 3 importing screens updated
- Removed all Zeno brand assets (10 x `zeno_*.png` image files from `assets/brand/`)
- Fixed `ZENO` comment in `radd-hub/hub/routes/library.py`
- Created full agent-hub system: README, SKILLS, SETUP, PROMPT, project docs, install script, task log
- Added per-project `.md` files: `radd-hub/README.md`, `raddflix_flutter/README.md`
- Added root `README.md`

### Notes for Next Agent
- Zero JazzMAX or Zeno references remain anywhere in the codebase (verified by grep)
- `hub/_legacy/` exists on server ONLY — it is intentionally excluded from GitHub (`.gitignore`). Do not try to add it to GitHub.
- Supervisor service names are still `jazzmax_radd` and `jazzmax_watch` — these are internal only and intentionally left as-is (renaming requires editing conf files + full restart cycle, low priority)
- Flutter app has not been built yet — no APK generated. That is the obvious next task.
- WA bot and TG bot are not yet fully implemented — see `agent-hub/projects/wa-bot.md`
- Many features are still missing from the Flutter app — a feature backlog should be created
